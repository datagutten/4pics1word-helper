=================

A helper to find solutions for the game "4 Pics 1 Word"

Some required files are not made by me and you will need to get them other places:
arial.ttf: Get it from c:\windows\fonts on a windows computer
images folder: Extract the jpg files starting with _ from ipa
photodata.txt: Extract it from the ipa
